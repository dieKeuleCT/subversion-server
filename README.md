# subversion-server

Simple Subversion Server for my own needs. Based on Alpine Linux and easy to use because of simple environment variable configuration
It was decided to do a by repository configuration, as it is not given that there are global access rights for all the repositories


## Config Options
### SVNROOT
Root - directory for SVN Server where all the repositories are stored in.
-v <your-svn-root>:/home/svnroot
